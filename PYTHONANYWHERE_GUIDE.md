## 💡 **Alternative: Try Railway One More Time**

The Railway fix I just pushed should work now. The issue was:
- ❌ **Old**: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app` (PORT variable not expanded)
- ✅ **New**: `gunicorn app:app` (Railway handles port automatically)

**Try your Railway URL again - it might work now!**

1. **More reliable** for beginners
2. **No environment variable confusion**
3. **Visual file management**
4. **Better error messages**
5. **Works 99% of the time**
