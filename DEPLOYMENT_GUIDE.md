## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. **Scikit-learn Compilation Error (FIXED!)**
**Error**: `'int_t' is not a type identifier` - Python 3.13 compatibility issue
**Solution**: We've updated to:
- Python 3.11.5 (in runtime.txt)
- Compatible dependency versions (in requirements.txt)

#### 2. **Alternative Solutions if Build Still Fails:**
If you still get build errors, try these files instead:

**Option A: Use requirements-minimal.txt**
```bash
# Rename the file in your repository
mv requirements.txt requirements-backup.txt
mv requirements-minimal.txt requirements.txt
# Then redeploy
```

**Option B: Use Railway instead of Render**
Railway has better build caching and may handle dependencies better.

#### 3. **Other Common Issues:**
1. **Model not loading**: Ensure models/ directory is committed to Git
2. **Dependencies missing**: Check requirements.txt has all packages
3. **Port issues**: App is configured to use environment PORT variable

### Testing Locally:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# Visit: http://localhost:5000
```
